# algo-efficiency-mini-project-karan
README.md Material

Goal: To analyze and compare the efficiency of common sorting and searching algorithms, and to visualize their time and space behavior.

Context: Software engineers often need to choose the most efficient algorithm for a problem, and this project explores the performance trade-offs of different recursive and iterative approaches.

Learning Objectives: The project aims to help you apply key algorithmic characteristics and visualize time/space trade-offs using plots and profiling tools.
